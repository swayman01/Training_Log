# Training_Log (WIP)
This is a training log that I created to track my online workouts and help select the workout that I want to do now.
Features:
 - Workouts grouped by category, sorted from most recent. Workouts may appear in more than one category
 - Bolded workouts that I want to repeat
 - Open workouts by clicking on the title
 To decide on a workout, I scroll (or search) from the bottom up and pick the first one that fits.
